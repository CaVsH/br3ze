## Hi there 👋

> quietly exploring vulnerabilities, one flag at a time.

Welcome to my corner of the internet. I’m currently on a focused journey into cybersecurity and ethical hacking, with the goal of becoming a penetration tester.

- 🧠 Learning via [TryHackMe – Cyber Security 101 Path](https://tryhackme.com/)
- 🔎 Interested in reverse engineering, recon, and stealthy persistence
- 🎯 Currently solving CTFs, documenting my process, and building my skillset

I don’t always say much, but the code and flags will speak for themselves.
